# Deep-Learning-Project-DS677
A repository for our Deep Learning Project


This also a link to the repository we will be using as a reference for our Project:

https://github.com/GitiHubi/deepAI




**Objective: Create code, report, and video to explain our DL model.**

**Week 1 (due 4/20)**

- [x] Understand Milestone 3 requirements (milestone 3 due 5/11)

- [x] Understand the deepAI GitHub Page (includes paper, colab, and everything else) 

- [x] Understanding the objective and goal of deepAI (model architecture, parameters, inputs, outputs)

**Week 2 (due 4/27)**

- [x] Replicate the papers results in our own code (implement code and replicate numerical results from model) 

- [x] Discuss who is going to work on experimenting with each section (preprocessing) 

- [x] Perhaps each person will experiment their own version of each section (one person does one type of preprocessing, one person another, etc.) 

- [x] Each person experiment with code on their own end

- [x] Only adding code to existing colab with consensus from group 

- [ ] Potentially meet with professor to clarify we are on the right page, and seek feedback

**Week 3 (due 5/4)**

- [ ] Writing the report document to explain our code and our model

- [ ] Drafting concept for the video

**Week 4 (due due 5/11, final project due)**

- [ ] Record video and finalize report
